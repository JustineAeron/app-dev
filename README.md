# 28 Days Later
## Sypnosis
*The story begins with animal liberation activists breaking into a research lab and unwittingly releasing a highly contagious virus known as "Rage," which is transmitted through blood and saliva and causes extreme aggression.*

*28 days after the outbreak, Jim (played by Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a deserted hospital in London, unaware of what has transpired. As he explores the eerily empty streets, he encounters a small group of survivors: Selena (Naomie Harris), Mark (Noah Huntley), and later, Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). Together, they embark on a perilous journey, seeking safety from the infected and other dangers in a ravaged world.*
